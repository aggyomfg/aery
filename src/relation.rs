/// Exclusive relations that face bottom up in hierarchies have
/// many favorable properties so these are the default.
///
/// Note that relations:
/// - Must be a [ZST](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#zero-sized-types-zsts).
/// This simply means that there can be no data on the edge.
/// A compile error will be produced if you try to use a relation that isn't one.
/// - Cannot be self referential. Ie. an entity cannot target itself with a relationship it hosts.
/// If this is ever attempted a warning will be logged & the relationship will not be set.
///
/// Aery only supports relations that are non-fragmenting. Ie. an entities archetype is not affected
/// by the targets of its relations. See [this article](https://ajmmertens.medium.com/building-an-ecs-2-archetypes-and-vectorization-fe21690805f9)
/// for more information. This isn't necessarily good or bad. Archetype fragmentation is a more

/// `bevy_hierarchy` if it supported multiple hierarchy types.
